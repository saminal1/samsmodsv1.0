## Sam's Sustainable Forestry
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmodsv1.0/tree/main/SSustainableForestry

Almost completely removes seeds from the game; there is a small chance to drop a modified seed which will grow into a random tree, rather than always to the same exact shape. Reduces the visual and performance impacts of players building dense tree farms at their bases.

Comments in the blocks.xml file should allow users to modify seed drop chance (or disable it completely) and regrowth time - default 1 hour.

## Sam's Karmah Remains

Leaves behind a corpse block when players die. Great for horde bases!

## Sam's Car and Truck Respawner
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmodsv1.0/tree/main/SCarRespawner

After harvesting, cars, trucks, busses, tractors, excavators and backhoes leave behind a respawner block which will replace them with another vehicle after an hour. The respawners are tied to the type of vehicle that was destroyed, so a bus will respawn in a bus spot and a truck will respawn in a truck spot.

### Sam's Long Loot Bags

Doubles the length of time loot bags will persist in the world. Handy for horde nights when you can't loot them until it's over.
